AxCrypt Open Source File Encryption for Windows
===============================================

AxCrypt is a set of programs for strong encryption of individual or groups of files in Windows. It
integrates with Windows Explorer to provide right-click and double-click integration into Windows
making it very easy to use.

There is no configuration necessary, AxCrypt makes appropriate choices for you, and is targeted for
general use by consumers and professionals in for example translation, health care, law, IT management,
power and water utilities, contractors etc. In brief, anyone with a need to maintain personal, client
or patient confidentiality should benefit from using AxCrypt.

No special technical skills are required to use AxCrypt, beyond general computer skills enabling you
to download and install software from the Internet and basic use of Windows.

While the installation is in English, the program is translated into many languages - hopefully yours.

If you would like to contribute a translation, please send an e-mail to mailto:software@axantum.com .

In addition to basic use, AxCrypt can also be integrated into IT management solutions and other software.

AxCrypt is fully open source licensed under GPL and can be built and developed using entirely free tools
such as Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express, MSBuild 4.0 and Windows Installer XML (WiX) 4.5 toolset.
